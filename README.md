This SeamCarver project is defined in full at https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/cs159/s22/projects/p2/.

The current state of the project is fully compiled and there are three command line arguments not listed in the description that must be provided when running the program as such:

    java Main <filename> <seam type> <num pixels> 

Where the filename is the full name of the image to be cropped, the seam type is one of two flags: -h for cropping horizontal seams and -v for cropping vertical seams. 

The num pixles is an optional argument and represents the number of horizontal or vertical seams to be cropped. This number cannot exeed the height or width of the image.
